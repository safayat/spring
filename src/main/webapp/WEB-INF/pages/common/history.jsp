                        <p>is a non-sectarian, co-educational college preparatory day school located northwest of downtown Houston, Texas. BSOH, which opened in September 2000, offers education for ages 3 to 18 (UK Nursery to Year 13/US Pre-K to Grade 12). The British School of Houston is a part of Nord Anglia Education which operates 27 schools in 11 countries, including six in the USA.[1] Previously it was operated by the British Schools of America</p>

                        <p>
                            The school's enrollment grew quickly after it opened, when it had 75 students. By December 2000 the school had 82 students, with 12 on the waiting list for January, when three more teachers were scheduled to begin employment with the school. O'Reilly-Askew said that she was not surprised by the increase of interest in the school.
